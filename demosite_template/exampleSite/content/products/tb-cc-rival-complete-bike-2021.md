This is what happens when mountain bikers make a road bike. The Santa Cruz Bicycles Stigmata CC Rival Complete Bike began its life as a cyclocross bike, and has steadily morphed into a gravel grinding adventure machine. This latest iteration has fender mounts and can accept three water bottles, making it clear that this isnâ€™t only for spandex-clad racers going around in the muddy circles. Its aggressive stance, 700c wheels, and 1x drivetrain will surely be seen on some race podiums, but this is a bike that will probably be chosen for longer adventures. The Stigmata is a great commuter, a long distance dirt road endurance bike, and a capable cyclocross bike: a drop bar roadie with the soul of a mountain bike!
