A shorter travel trail bike that’s as low and slack as DH bikes from only a handful of years ago, the Juliana Joplin C S Complete Mountain Bike is prepared to set your local singletrack ablaze. With only 130 / 120mm of travel, you may not think it’s as capable as bigger bikes, but its forward-thinking geometry puts it ahead of bikes with much more squish. The front end’s slack, the rear shock has been repositioned to give a progressive leverage curve, and the bike just plain rips. Efficient and precise, it’s as nimble as your reactions will allow, but the geometry and suspension make it extremely stable at speed. This carbon S-build features trail-proven components from SRAM and Fox.
