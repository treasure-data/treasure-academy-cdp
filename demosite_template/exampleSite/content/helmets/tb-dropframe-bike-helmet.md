Calling all enduro bros and enduro gals. The Fox Dropframe Bike Helmet has landed! This maximum coverage trail lid protects the ears and back of head while still leaving the face open. A trusty ABS shell houses the Varizorb® EPS liner while 8 big vents and a visor push air through the shell for exceptional comfort on longer rides. Capped off with a Fidlock® buckle for easy on/off, the Fox Dropframe Bike Helmet is a stage crushing machine that has big style and ample protection you can count on.
