They are on top of mind but rarely thought about, a compulsory part of riding that doesn’t have anything to do with the bike and a literal life saver for the cost of a tee-shirt. That’s right, bicycle helmets aren’t generally a huge consideration in the bike riding experience but they could prove to be the difference between surviving a crash or not. Modern day helmets are as much about performance and style as they are about safety, and wearing one is required by law in Australia, so it’s critical to make an informed decision about what sits on your noggin.

We’ve put together this guide to help explain how a helmet works, the features to look out for, the difference between helmet types and what you can expect for a set budget.

Safety standards
In many states, you are required by law to wear an approved helmet while riding your bike. This is to consist of a protective shell, liner and retention strap underneath the jaw. Approved helmets meet requirements of construction, design, performance, markings and safe use instructions and are some of the most stringent in the world.

There are some specific requirements regarding permanent attachments such as no external rigid projections greater than 5mm in height and no internal projections likely to cause injury. There are also requirements of the materials used such as guaranteed durability when exposed to sunlight, extreme temperatures and rain, and stability under the influence of aging. And perhaps most importantly, helmets also need to comply with performance elements such as not obscuring vision, significantly reducing the force to a cyclist’s head upon impact, distribute the force of an impact and provide secure enough hold to remain on a cyclist’s head in the event of an accident.

It’s clear to see the development of a helmet is extensive, which is further reinforced by Lazer’s Product Manager Audrey Yu who explains that, “it takes at least one year (at the minimum) of sketching, designing, 3D work, testing, sampling, certification, pilot runs and graphic design before there is talk about production. For high-end helmets, this period runs close to 2 years.”

The extensive list of requirements should provide all cyclists with peace of mind when strapping on an approved helmet.

A helmet’s primary role is to prevent head injury in the event of a crash. In order to do so, helmet’s must have a means of absorbing impact energy, a means of distributing load and a retention system.

In order to absorb and distribute the load, helmets are made from a polystyrene foam that compresses on impact that cushions the blow and distributes the force. As this foam can split or get caught, a hard, smooth outer shell is used on the outside of the helmet to keep the foam together and enable the helmet to slide on the ground to avoid any jerking movements which could damage the neck. This outer shell also adds a layer of protection to puncture type accidents which the foam would otherwise be susceptible to. Most outer shells are made from plastic but some more expensive models use carbon fiber composite for greater strength and less weight.

A helmet should stay on in normal conditions without the aid of the retention system underneath the jaw but this system is required to prevent the helmet coming off following jolting forces and fast changes of direction caused by secondary impacts and movements.

Another feature you’ll commonly see is padding on the inside of the helmet but this is purely for comfort and not protection.

Fit
Getting the right fit is essential with any helmet. We all have different size and shaped heads that need to be taken into account, otherwise, the safety of the helmet could be compromised.

Sizing: Brands will typically have ‘small’, ‘medium’ and ‘large’ size helmets but these are not governed by any standards and so what is medium in one brand may not match with a small in another brand. As a result, you’ll need to measure the circumference of your head and check the helmet sizing to ensure the correct fit. To do this, simply wrap a tape measure around your the widest part of your head, starting approximately 2cm above your brow line. The helmet should fit snugly enough to remain in place if you were to hang upside without the aid of the retention system.
Shape: Helmet shape is not something many brands talk about, however, it’s worth knowing that each brand has its own idea of what someone’s head is shaped like. Italian brands are typically narrower, while American brand helmets typically feature a more rounded shape. While it’s possible to measure for sizing, shape is something that really means you have to try on the helmet before purchase.
Retention system: Some brands refer to their retention system as a ratchet system used to tighten an inner shell, but in this case, we are referring to the retention system underneath the chin. When properly tightened you should be able to fit two fingers between the strap and your chin and the strap should make a V shape underneath your ears. Both areas should be easy to adjust and remain securely in place.
Tightening mechanism: Many helmets have a secondary retention system that tightens an inner shell or brace around your head and occipital bone (the back and lower area of your head). This system creates a snug fit and another layer of comfort and stability. However, it’s important to ensure the shell shape is right and that you don’t rely purely on the tightening mechanism for what’s otherwise a poorly fitting helmet.
Pressure points: When trying on a helmet, be mindful of any pressure points or uneven pressure throughout the helmet. Any pressure in a given area suggests the helmet is the wrong size or the wrong shape for your head.
Hair port: For those of you with long hair, a hair port may be a consideration. The port is designed at the rear of the helmet to accommodate ponytails without influencing the fit or safety of a helmet.
Sunglasses: If you’re one to ride with glasses or sunglasses, it’s a good idea to ensure your helmet fits with your eyewear. The only way to check this is to take your eyewear with you when trying on helmets. Make sure the helmet’s shell or tightening mechanism doesn’t touch the frame or arms of your glasses.
It doesn’t matter how well a helmet fits if it isn’t properly secured, so here is a quick video that explains how to fit a helmet.

Safety
As a minimum, you should be checking that your helmet has the sticker indicating it meets the required safety standards. Additionally, there are also other safety factors that could influence your decision.

MIPS (Multi-directional Impact Protection System) is a relatively new concept that is starting to appear on more and more helmets. The concept is based around reducing the rotational force and the amount of energy transferred to the head in the event of a crash. In order to do this, a thin, low friction liner is positioned on the inside of the helmet that allows the outer shell to move very small amounts on impact. Reducing the energy transferred to the head results in less significant injuries and reducing the rotational force is thought to significantly decrease a concussion.

Product Manager of Monza Sports Sean Du Toit explains some of the technology that features in Bell’s helmets. “As well as MIPS that most of our helmets feature, Bell also offers several helmet designs incorporating Progressive Layering™ construction, incorporating two separate layers of EPS foam in different densities to address a wide range of impact energies. On the mountain side, we have models featuring a patented tool-free removable chin bar design that converts a helmet from full-face protection to a lighter and more ventilated option—like two helmets in one.”

The number of vents a helmet has and the color are two other factors that could vastly improve safety. A brightly colored helmet will enhance a rider’s visibility reducing the chance of being hit by other road users. And while it might seem like more of a fashion or heat consideration, the number of vents can influence safety too. Large or multiple vents can reduce the amount of contact between the helmet and the head, which could reduce the helmet’s ability to distribute force.

A final consideration is the length of time you’ve had your current helmet. There is no hard and fast rule of the expiry date of a helmet but some manufacturers may have replacement guidelines of when to upgrade to a new one, regardless of if it has been involved in a crash or not. As a general rule, if the colors of your helmet are sun faded or the strap is fraying, the time for replacement was many years ago.

If you have had a crash, then your helmet needs to be replaced immediately. The foam that cushions the impact does not bounce back and so helmets should be thought of as a single use item in the event of a crash. Some manufacturers have a crash replacement program, providing riders with a discount on replacement helmets following a crash. And while it might not seem obvious straight away, even dropping your helmet from a height could be enough to compress the foam layer and require a new one.
